# Partner Days Workshop

For developers who have no experience building integrations with Cloud Foundry, or simply need a refresher on a key topic.  This workshop provides hands-on training for the following topics:  
Cloud-Native apps, Cloud Foundry architecture, pushing applications to Cloud Foundry, services, service brokers, and BOSH releases. The course is intended for software developers who want to learn how to build integrations for Cloud Foundry - it is not intended to train app developers how to use Cloud Foundry or IT admins how to operate a Cloud Foundry installation.
